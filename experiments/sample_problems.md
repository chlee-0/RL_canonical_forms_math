# Brainstorming: RL and Canonical Forms

This document lists candidate pure math problems centered around canonical forms / canonical representatives.


## Action of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb Z)$ on the projective line

We consider the group
$$\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb Z)
=\left\{
\begin{matrix}a&b\\ c&d\end{matrix}
: a,b,c,d\in\mathbb Z,\ ad-bc=1
\right\},
$$
and its action on the projective line
$$\mathbb P^1(\mathbb Q)=\mathbb Q\cup\{\infty\}$$
by fractional linear transformations
$$z\longmapsto \frac{az+b}{cz+d},$$
with the usual conventions for $z=\infty$ and $cz+d=0$.

The standard generators are
$$S=\begin{matrix}0&-1\\ 1&0\end{matrix},\quad
T=\begin{matrix}1&1\\ 0&1\end{matrix}.$$



## Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)

Let $F$ be a field and $A\in M_{m,n}(F)$.

A matrix $R\in M_{m,n}(F)$ is in **reduced row echelon form (RREF)** if:

1. Any row consisting entirely of zeros, if present, occurs below all nonzero rows.
2. In any nonzero row, the first nonzero entry (the *leading* entry) is $1$ (a pivot).
3. The leading entry in a given row occurs in a column strictly to the right of the leading entry in the row above it.
4. Each pivot is the only nonzero entry in its column.

It is a standard fact that every matrix $A$ is row-equivalent to a unique RREF.


- Example

  $$\displaystyle
  A=\begin{matrix}
  1&2&1&1\\
  2&4&0&6\\
  3&6&3&7
  \end{matrix}
  \;\longrightarrow\;
  \mathrm{RREF}(A)=
  \begin{matrix}
  1&2&0&0\\
  0&0&1&0\\
  0&0&0&1
  \end{matrix}.
  $$


## Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and diagonalization

Let $A\in\mathbb R^{m\times n}$. A **singular value decomposition** (SVD) of $A$ is a factorization
$$A = U\,\Sigma\,V^{\top},$$
where
- $U \in \mathbb R^{m\times m}$ and $V \in \mathbb R^{n\times n}$ are orthogonal,
- $\Sigma \in \mathbb R^{m\times n}$ is diagonal (rectangular), with nonnegative diagonal entries
  $\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_r \ge 0$ and all other entries $0$.

The numbers $\sigma_i$ are the **singular values** of $A$.  
We usually arrange them in nonincreasing order $\sigma_1\ge\cdots\ge\sigma_r>0$; with this ordering, they are uniquely determined, though the singular vectors may not be.


- Mathematical definition
  - Any real matrix $A$ admits an SVD
    $$A=U\,\Sigma\,V^{\top},\quad \Sigma=\mathrm{diag}(\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_r),\ \sigma_1\ge\cdots\ge\sigma_r\ge 0.$$
  - $U,V$ are orthogonal. If singular values are sorted in descending order, then $\Sigma$ is unique (up to basis choice within degenerate blocks).

- 2×2 example
Compute an explicit SVD for a simple $2\times 2$ matrix, for example
  $$
  A =
  \begin{matrix}
    3 & 1\\
    0 & 2
  \end{matrix},
  $$


## Orthogonal diagonalization of symmetric matrices

Let $A\in\mathbb R^{n\times n}$ be a real symmetric matrix.  
The **spectral theorem** states that there exists an orthogonal matrix $Q$ and a real diagonal matrix $\Lambda$ such that
$$A = Q\,\Lambda\,Q^{\top}.$$

The diagonal entries of $\Lambda$ are the (real) eigenvalues of $A$, and the columns of $Q$ form an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors.


## Smith Normal Form (SNF)

Let $A\in\mathbb Z^{m\times n}$. A **Smith normal form** of $A$ is a diagonal integer matrix
$$D = \mathrm{diag}(d_1,\dots,d_r,0,\dots,0)$$
with integers $d_i>0$ satisfying
$$d_1 \mid d_2 \mid \cdots \mid d_r,$$
together with unimodular matrices $U\in\mathrm{GL}(m,\mathbb Z)$ and $V\in\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb Z)$ such that
$$UAV = D.$$

The $d_i$ are called the **invariant factors** of $A$.


## The 15-puzzle (sliding puzzle)

Consider the classical **15-puzzle**: a $4\times4$ board with tiles numbered $1,\dots,15$ and one blank square (total 16 cells).  
Legal moves slide a tile adjacent (up/down/left/right) to the blank into the blank position.

The **goal configuration** is the ordered layout with tiles $1,2,\dots,15$ and the blank in the bottom-right corner.

It is a classical fact that exactly half of the $16!$ possible arrangements of the 16 positions are reachable from the goal configuration by legal moves; the other half are impossible.

## Rubik’s Cube (3×3×3)

Consider the standard **3×3×3 Rubik’s Cube**.  
Let $G$ be the group generated by quarter- and half-turns of the six faces $U,D,L,R,F,B$.  
The elements of $G$ act on the set of cube states; the **solved state** is treated as the canonical reference configuration.

The full state space has size
$$
|G|\approx 4.3\times 10^{19},
$$
and there are well-known global invariants such as orientation parity of edges and corners.
